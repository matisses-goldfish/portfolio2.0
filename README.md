## Purpose of Homework (reference)
"A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies."

## Acceptance Criteria (reference):

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Overall Goal
My main goal of this project is to create a website that highlights my tallents and skills with the use of orginized html and css features.

## My Process 

1. STEP 1: Create my concept. 
    * HOW?: I opend a google slide doc and planned out the different aspects i wannted to include on my website. I used the webframe tatic which included headers, body elements, footers, and image placement. 



2. STEP 2: Design my concept.
    * HOW?: Next, I opened figma and choose my color pallet of light pink and dark green (two of my favorite colors), then used my webframe reference and planned out the aesthetic aspects, such as fonts. 



3. STEP 3: create basic HTML. 
    * HOW?: Using both my figma and webframe, I based my html off of my webframe and the information I wanted to include (links, titles, images, anchors, and paragraphs), and my css skills to make it look like my figma mock up. Figma also includes a features that allows you the inspect the elements you included in your mock up, so I used that for text placement and size.
