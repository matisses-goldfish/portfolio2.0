## Overall Goal
---
My main goal of this project is to create a website that highlights my tallents and skills with the use of orginized html, css, and javascript features. 


## Process:
---

1. STEP 1: Create my concept. 
    * I began mapping my concept in figma. After creating a general outline of what results I wanted from my intended application, I begain mapping a wireframe that woul allow me to create a div layout for using Bootstrap.



2. STEP 2: Design my concept.
    * I mapped out a minimilistic concept that would be realitivly simplictic to exicute. Some additional assets I included in my portfolio was a color-changing scroll function, and rotational slideshow. 



3. STEP 3: created HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
    * By applying my previous conepts, and conducting various research on code sinipets that would provide me my desired results, I created my Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Although this is a project I will be continuiously working on, I beleive my results were acheived.
